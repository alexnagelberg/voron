Simple shitty adapter for putting adafruit adxl345 on the revo nozzle. To use, pull out the nozzle, mount the board to the adapter, pull the nozzle out, slide the adapter over the nozzle so that the open part faces towards the nozzle. It should make a sandwich when you attach the nozzle to the heater and cover the nozzle/sock.

You'll probably need supports to print. Normal voron settings otherwise.
