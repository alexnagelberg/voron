This includes an adapter for attaching HartK's PCB to LGX. Note: I had to put the JST connector on the front so that probably reverses a lot of the pins for the stepper and needs to be accounted for with the 14 pin connector or stepper connector.

BOM:
* 1x m3 heat inset
* 1x m3 6mm BHCS (you can use SHCS or FHCS for these -- shouldn't matter)
* 1x m3 12mm BHCS
* 1x m3 10mm BHCS

The 6mm BHCS gets screwed in to the same hole as the inset -- the only hole that doesn't line up with the LGX. Adapter goes on right side. The two holes that are raised (for spacers) match with the PCB (for more help on orientation, look at the CAD). The 12mm goes all the way through the board/adapter in to LGX, 10mm goes through the hole without spacer in to adapter/LGX only.
